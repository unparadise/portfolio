    <p>Hi, my name is Frank Chen. I am a passionate designer with 10+
      years of expereince working at the forefront of
      technolog from mobile devices back in 2008 to HoloLens in
      2017. Technology is a double edged sword and I believe that it
      is our responsibility to shape it so that it helps the
      individuals and the collective human race to grow and
      thrive. My hero is <a href="http://www.worrydream.com" target="_blank">Bret Victor.</a> You
      can find a copy of my <a href="frank_chen_resume.pdf">resume</a> here.</p>

    <p>Below are a few projects I have worked on recently.</p>

    <h2><a name="adaptive_control">Spatial UI (HoloLens)</a></h2>

    <p>HoloLens and Universal Windows Apps are two separate
      platforms Microsoft owns. They are separate from each
      other. Apps developed for the Windows platform can work in
      HoloLens but the interaction is suboptimal. This is an
      explorative effort with the goal to improve the experience of
      Windows apps in HoloLens. This video is demonstrated at the 2018
      Microsoft Build conference.</p>

    </video>

    <p>I led the UX exploration and did the interaction exploration in
      3DS Max and worked with a motion designer to produce the final
      video. I also drove the team's patent effort and at the end of
      the project, we filed 3 patents to protect the IP.</p>

    <p>I started with the desktop Mail app. Broken it down into
    different functioning zones and explored how interaction with
      each functioning zone can be improved in VR/AR space. For
      example, the experience with the content commanding requires
      the user to use the 6-DOF controller to aim at very small
      button far away from where she stands. It makes the interaction
      error prone and time consuming.</p>

    <p>Here is another motion study showing experience from first
      person POV. The content is summoned to a 6-DOF controller to
      simulate "holding" the content naturally.</p>

      <h2><a name="new_location_exp">New location Experience</a></h2>
      <p>The Journey team in WinNEXT owns the Maps application on
      Windows. Due to the nature of the Maps app, it engagement stays
      relatively flat over the past year even though it provides a
      solid experience. The new location experience focuses on bring
      people and friends together by integrating discovery and
      collective planning features in Windows Maps app and by
	creating a new standalone iOS and Android app.</p>

      <p>I started to learn Framer when I worked on this project and
      below are some Framer prototypes I made to explore the mobile
      concept.</p>

      <h2><a name="generative_design">Generative design concept exploration</a></h2>

      <p>This is a side project in which I experimented with using
	generative design to explore brand concepts. The goal is to
	convey the feeling of unique identity and connection. The tool
	I used was <a href="www.processing.org">Processing.</a> Below are
	some examples of the type of visual patterns that can be
	generated using the program.</p>
      
      <img src="./images/generative_design/1.png" width="600">

    <p>By reducing the connection length, the point size, and
      increasing the number of points on the sphere, the underlying
      sphere shape becomes more obvious in this pattern (below).<p>
      <img src="./images/generative_design/2.png" width="600">
      <img src="./images/generative_design/3.png" width="600">

      <p>In this example (below), with the number of points reduced and the
      connection length increased, the patterns looks very different
      from the ones above.</p>
      <img src="./images/generative_design/4.png" width="600">
      
      <p>Here is a video recording of the interactive program that
      show cases the different visuals can be generated by adjusting
      the parameters.</p>
